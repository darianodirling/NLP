prompt_input = """You're building a Biblical Wisdom Chatbot to provide guidance and advice rooted in scripture. Your task is to create a chatbot that responds to user inquiries with relevant biblical quotes and advice.

1. Understand the user's query and context.
2. Retrieve relevant biblical quotes or advice based on the query.
3. Present the retrieved information in a coherent and helpful manner.

Your task is to write code that achieves this functionality. You may use any programming language and libraries of your choice. Ensure that your chatbot provides accurate and meaningful responses consistent with biblical teachings. Test your chatbot with different queries to ensure its effectiveness and accuracy.
